# Windows Development Environment Rule

- All development is performed on Windows.
- The terminal is PowerShell. All commands, scripts, and documentation must be compatible with PowerShell.
- Do not use Linux commands, shell syntax, or make Linux-specific assumptions.
- Validate all file paths and scripts for Windows compatibility.
